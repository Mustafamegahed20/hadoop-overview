# External query engiens

Time to talk about query engines!

This would allow us to execute SQL queries across any data

## World of hadoop

We've talked about all the core ecosystem, as well as the external data setorages (casandra, mongo, sql, HBase)

Up next, query engines!

# Query engines: 

## Apache Drill

Allows us to issue queries across stuff like MongoDB, files in S3, GCloud, Hive, HBase, etc etc etc

Drill can talk to MongoDB (but not cassandra...)

## Apache phonex

Sits on top of HBase, sits on top of other technologies as well...

From app standpoint it belongs in this sector

## Presto

Similar to Drill, where you can execute SQL.

Made by facebook - open source now!

Can talk to Cassandra (but not mongodb...)

Let's dive into DRILL

# It's time for DRILL

Sits on top of various technologies, aand a lot of non-database data

* A SQL query engine for a variety of non-relational database files
    - Hive, Mongo, HBAse
    - Even flat JSON or parquet files on HDFS, S3, Azure, GCloud, local FS..
* Based on Google's Dremel

It's based in another google technology!

Just like MR translates to Hadoop
And HBase is google's big table...
Drill = Google's Dremel!

All is google ideas!
# main features
   - connectivity to multiple datastores.
   - distributed execution engine for processing queries
   - it has JDBC/ODBC drivers
   - supports many complex data types
   - allows sql analysis of disparate data
   - decentralized data management
   - 
## It's real SQL!

* Not SQL-like...
* Any SQL Query you can dream about
    - Even on some text file (json-like)
    - It can take the place of Hive in some place
    - HIVE allows you to execute hiveql
    - Drill allows you to do that but with real SQL
* And it has a ODBC / JDBC driver so other tools can connect to it just like any relational database!

# It's fast and pretty easy to set up

* But remember these are still non-relational databases under the hood!!
    - Even it brags about doing stuff fast, it's still not made to do stuff it's not made to do 
    - Don't use nosql and non relational databases and slap drill on top unless you need to use it
* Allows SQL analysis of disparate data source without having to transform and load it first
    - IE having sql without a schema
    - Internally data is represented as JSON and so has no fixed schema

If you want to know how drill works in the apache website.

If you know how to write SQL queries, you can use Drill... hiding the complexity from user it's interesting.

# Joining across databases

* You can join stuff across json files that are just sitting around
* Thing of it as SQL for your entire ecosystem

# Let's drill

* We'll import data into Hive and MongoDB
* Set up drill on top of both
* And do some queries
