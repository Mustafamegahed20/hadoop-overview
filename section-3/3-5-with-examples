# PigLatin: Diving Deeper

PigLatin is a high-level data flow scripting language designed for processing and analyzing large datasets in Apache Hadoop. It simplifies the process of writing MapReduce jobs by providing a more intuitive and expressive way to work with data.

## Key PigLatin Operations and Functions with Examples

### LOAD, STORE, DUMP
- **LOAD**: Load data into a Pig relation from various sources.
  - Example:
    ```
    data = LOAD 'input.txt' USING PigStorage(',') AS (name: chararray, age: int);
    ```

- **STORE**: Save the contents of a Pig relation into a specified location.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    STORE data INTO 'output' USING PigStorage(':');
    ```

- **DUMP**: Display the contents of a relation for debugging purposes.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    DUMP data;
    ```

### FILTER, DISTINCT, FOREACH / GENERATE
- **FILTER**: Filter rows based on a condition.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    filtered_data = FILTER data BY age > 18;
    ```

- **DISTINCT**: Remove duplicate rows from a relation.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    unique_data = DISTINCT data;
    ```

- **FOREACH / GENERATE**: Transform data by creating new columns or modifying existing ones.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    transformed_data = FOREACH data GENERATE name, age * 2 AS doubled_age;
    ```

### JOIN, COGROUP, GROUP, CROSS, CUBE
- **JOIN**: Perform inner joins between two or more relations.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    joined_data = JOIN data1 BY id, data2 BY id;
    ```

- **COGROUP**: Group data by a common key, creating separate tuples for each key.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    grouped_data = COGROUP data1 BY id, data2 BY id;
    ```

- **GROUP**: Aggregate data based on a key (similar to a reduce operation).
  - Example:
    ```pig
    grouped_data = GROUP data BY age;
    ```

- **CROSS**: Create all possible combinations between two relations (Cartesian product).
  - Example:
    ```pig
    crossed_data = CROSS data1, data2;
    ```

- **CUBE**: Generate even larger combinations by performing CROSS on more columns (not widely used).

### ORDER, RANK, LIMIT
- **ORDER**: Sort data in a relation based on one or more columns.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    sorted_data = ORDER data BY age;
    ```

- **RANK**: Assign rank numbers to rows without sorting them.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    ranked_data = RANK data;
    ```

- **LIMIT**: Restrict the number of rows in the output (useful for testing or sampling).
  - Example:
    ```pig
    limited_data = LIMIT data 10;
    ```

### UNION, SPLIT
- **UNION**: Combine the contents of multiple relations into a single relation.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    merged_data = UNION data1, data2;
    ```

- **SPLIT**: Divide a relation into multiple relations based on a condition.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    SPLIT data INTO over_18 IF age > 18, under_18 IF age <= 18;
    ```

### Diagnostics
- **DESCRIBE**: Display the schema of a relation.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    DESCRIBE data;
    ```

- **EXPLAIN**: Gain insights into how Pig will execute a given query.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    EXPLAIN transformed_data;
    ```

- **ILLUSTRATE**: Visualize data transformations by taking a sample of each relation at each step.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    ILLUSTRATE filtered_data;
    ```

### User Defined Functions (UDFs)
- **REGISTER**: Load a JAR file containing UDFs.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    REGISTER 'my_udfs.jar';
    ```

- **DEFINE**: Assign names to the functions defined in the registered JAR file.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    DEFINE myFunction com.example.MyUDF();
    ```

- **IMPORT**: Import macros into other Pig scripts for code reuse.
  - Example:
    ```pig
    IMPORT 'my_macros.pig';
    ```

### Other Functions and Loaders
Pig provides various built-in functions for common data processing tasks, including `AVG`, `CONCAT`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `SIZE`, and `SUM`. Additionally, there are various loaders for different data formats, such as `PigStorage`, `TextLoader`, `JsonLoader`, `AvroStorage`, `ParquetLoader`, `OrcStorage`, and `HBaseStorage` for integration with HBase.
