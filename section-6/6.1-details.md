# Why NoSQL:

## RDBs vs. NoSQL:
Relational databases (RDBs) are effective for SQL functionality, making them suitable for many applications, especially analytical work.
Scalability Challenge: RDBMS may not be as scalable when you need to answer specific questions at a large scale, like handling thousands of transactions per second.
## NoSQL Scalability: 
NoSQL systems are designed to scale horizontally indefinitely, making them well-suited for high-transaction rate applications.
Examples of Questions: NoSQL databases are suitable for answering questions like customer orders, lists, and more, especially at a large scale.
HBase:

## HBase and HDFS:
HBase is a relevant technology built on top of HDFS, the Hadoop Distributed File System. It provides a fast and scalable transactional system that stores data in a horizontally scalable manner within the HDFS cluster.
Exposure to Web Services: HBase can be exposed through web services, making it accessible for applications and users.
When RDBMS Don't Cut It:

NoSQL is valuable when you need to efficiently answer simple questions at high transaction rates. It's about handling data and access at a planet-sized scale.

## Scaling Up MySQL and Challenges:
Traditional databases like MySQL require extreme measures to scale up for massive loads. Challenges include denormalization, caching layers, master/slave setups, sharding, materialized views, and the removal of stored procedures.
Scaling relational databases to planet-scale access is complex and can be a support nightmare.


## Do You Really Need SQL:
In some cases, you may not need a full-fledged SQL database. Specific queries may be addressed more efficiently using APIs that fetch or store data based on keys.
High-transaction queries are often simple once data is denormalized. A simple get/put API can suffice for such cases.
Use the Right Tool for the Job:

For analytical queries, tools like HIVE, Pig, Spark, and others work well.
Exporting data to MySQL is fast for many applications. However, for handling data at a giant scale, NoSQL databases are more suitable.
Sample Application Architecture:

## The architecture consists of several components:

Data Source: The source of raw data.
Spark Streaming/YARN/HDFS: Real-time data processing, resource management, and storage.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing processed data.
Web Servers: Servers that deliver the application to users.
Happy Customers: End-users of the application.
Data flows from the data source to Spark Streaming for real-time processing. Processed data is stored in MongoDB, and web servers serve the application to end-users.

This architecture is designed to handle large-scale data processing and serve users efficiently, leveraging big data tools, NoSQL databases, and web servers for high-performance and scalability.
