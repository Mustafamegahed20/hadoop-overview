In Apache HBase, data is organized into tables, and the tables are made up of rows and columns. The structure of an HBase table is similar to a two-dimensional array, where each row has a unique row key, and the columns can be dynamic, meaning you can have a varying number of columns for each row. The tables are distributed across the HBase cluster, and they are optimized for fast random read and write access.

Here's an example of what the shape of an HBase table might look like:

Let's say you're building a table to store customer data for an e-commerce platform. Each row in the table represents a unique customer, and you can have columns to store various attributes about the customer.

Table Name: customer_data

Each row has a unique row key (customer1, customer2, customer3) that allows for fast and efficient access to individual customer records.
The table has two column families: personal_info and purchase_history.
Columns within each column family store specific data:
personal_info contains attributes like first name, last name, and email.
purchase_history contains data related to the products purchased and their quantities.
The number of columns in the purchase_history column family can vary for each row, as customers may have different purchase histories.
HBase's flexible column-oriented structure allows you to store a wide range of data and scale horizontally to handle large datasets while providing fast access to individual rows. The row key is crucial for efficient random access to the data, and HBase's distributed architecture ensures high availability and fault tolerance.
